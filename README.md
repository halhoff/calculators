Very simple calculator for calculating trigonometric functions I made when I first started coding.
It uses a fourth-degree taylor polynomial for cosine that can approximate values from -pi/2 to pi/2.
The function is shifted so it becomes cosine. Angle in radians is shifted so its in -pi/2 to pi/2 domain.

- Input function: either sin, cos, or tan.
- Input angle.

Outputs result. If it worked.
